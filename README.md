# null-gui
**null-gui** - is a graphical interface, originally developed as a semi-paste of imgui, but after a while I was no longer satisfied with the code base of the old project, and I decided to rewrite everything from scratch (but in the end I still pasted some parts of the code from other projects)

# todo
At the moment, it is necessary to rewrite some parts, facilitate the creation of new widgets and add support for layouts.
